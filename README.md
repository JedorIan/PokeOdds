# PokeOdds
A Pok√©mon odds calculator

This project is a free time project and will be periodically update over time.

I plan to have it include any generation with shinies, but that will take time.

The base odds shown as the base 1 in 4096 or 1 in 8192.

Not all selections are possible, such as breeding a shiny with the Rare Mark. What is shown is what would be possible.

NO DIRECT RECREATION OR COPY IS ALLOWED. But use it as a template if you want.
